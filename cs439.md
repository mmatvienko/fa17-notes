## Gheith's spinLock
```c++
class SpinLock{
    Atomic<bool> isTaken = false;
public:
    lock(){
        while(isTaken.exchange(true));
        // exchange returns value at location
    }
    unlock(){
        isTaken.set(false);
    }
}
```
If ```isTaken``` is true to start with you will just an infinite loop. If initially false, and is changed to true and that is returned, we know we are allowed to go and do work.

## Semaphore
```c++
class Semaphore {
    uint32_t count;
    Queue<Thread> blocked
public:
    Semaphore (uint32_t count) : count(count), blocked(new Queue<Thread>());
    void down(){
        if (count == 0){
            blocked.add(Thread::current);
            Thread::yield(); // don't add self to readyQ
        }else{
            count--; // being atomic would not help much
        }
    }
    void up(){}
}
```
You cannot surround ```down()``` with a lock i.e.
```c++
lock.lock(){

}lock.unlock
```
System would spin, and there would be no way to unlock the lock. Semaphore would be done with.
Must build mechanism to release the Semaphore


```c++
//down:
lock();
if(count == 0){
    blocked.add(me);
    unlock();
}
```
Thread A is running the former. Around the same time Thread B (runs the latter) gets spinlock and tries to help Thread A onto the readyQ
```c++
//up:
lock();
if(someoneIsWaiting){
    readyQ->add(someone);
}
```
* What if someone changes ```count``` while a thread is trying to block.
    * Run yield before unlock, and only unlock if yield is successful 
    * Add a new **DND** state that tells other threads not to bother you. Allowing you to finish your job


Create idleThread for cores to run when they have nothing to do.
```c++
if(first){
    //  .
    //  .
    //  .
    kernelMain();
}else{
    while(true)Thread::yield();
}
```
```currentThread``` using ```PerCPU```

Figuring out who you are using ```SMP::me()```

## Other uses of Semaphores
### Networking
* Consider multiple threads running on server, producing data
    * Called **Producers**
* Consumers, or workers
    * pick up what the produceres output and do work on given data
        * Called the Producer/Consumer problem
* Any data structure that does not forget, like a Queue, sits between them
    * Keep it atomic
* Put backpressure on Producers (flow control)
    * When consumers cannot handle work they tell Producers to ```Stop It```
    * Have to be able to tell Producers to wait if the finite-queue is full

### Bounded-buffer
Can handle the Q and telling the sender a status
```c++
template<typename T, int N> //N is # of elements in buffer
class BB{
    T data[N];
    void put(T e){ ... }
    T get(){ ... }
}
```
* Both ```put()``` and ```get()``` are able to block
    * In the scenario that the buffer is full on ```put()```, or if the buffer is empty on ```get()```
    * Must have two flags instead of semaphore to say whether semaphore is empty/full
```c++
class B <N>{
    Semaphore nEmpty = N;
    Semaphore nFull = 0;
    Semaphore lock; // just used for protection of data structure, could also be a spin

    put(T e){
        nEmpty.down(); // if nEmpty is 0, then you block
        lock.down();
        // need an atomic Q
        // .
        // . compete over it
        // .
        lock.up();
        nFull.up();
    }

    T get(){
        nFull.down();
        //compete over the Q
        nEmpty.up();

    }
}
```
By competing over the semaphore, we know that the right number of threads are allowed in.
```c++
lock.down();
// need an atomic Q
// .
// . compete over it
// .
lock.up();
```
This is simply a thread safe Q

### Example of bad put and get
```c++
//put:
lock();
nEmpty.down();
//.
//.
//.
nFull.up();
unlock();

//get:
lock();
nFullDown();
//.
//.
//.
nEmpty.up();
unlock();
```
By swapping pairs of commands, we can be deadlock free
