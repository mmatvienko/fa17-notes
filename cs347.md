# CS347: Data Management
## Midterm 
* You will be surprised by how hard the midterm is
* Just prepare yourself
* Might give us relational algebra problem with 2 or 3 relational operators
* Question 1 is always a definition question
## B+ Trees: primary method of data management on disks
* Introduces indexes
    * For tree structured indexes O(n) becomes O(log(n))
* So superior that B trees never actually happened
* Need a query optimizers that can take advantage of these indexes
* All the data is in the data file, and is organized by blocks
    * Sorted by the primary key
    * If it is possible, it is contiguous on disk
    * They fan out a little further than binary trees
* **Primary Key** is how the index is organized
    * These do not have to be unique
* **Secondary Key** allows for an additional access path
    * Must be allowed to be not unique
* Really the worst case is O(n)
* First you have to sequentially scan table and then can create secondary index??
    * Table in notes has 3 **access paths**
* Good to fatten the nodes and increase fanout in a binary tree

### R 'join' S is proportional to R x S
* If 1 million elements, takes 1 million squared time
* **With secondary key, do indexed loop joins**
    * Most of the time it behaves nlog(n)
* Optimizer recongizes there details exist and uses them to choose an algorithm like **indexed loop joins**
```SQL
CREATE INDEX TC_T_Inventors ON T_INVENTORS(iid); 
/*On default creates secondary index on fk*/
```

### Spare index ###
* not every record's key value is stored in the index
* i.e. if you can't find data in the index, you have to check the sequential file
* more of index can be kept in memory though
### Dense Index ###
paragraph
* Can tell if a record exists without accessing a data file
