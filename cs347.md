# CS347: Data Management
## Midterm 
* You will be surprised by how hard the midterm is
* Just prepare yourself
* Might give us relational algebra problem with 2 or 3 relational operators
* Question 1 is always a definition question
## B+ Trees: primary method of data management on disks
* Problem with binary trees was the constant balancing of nodes
* Introduces indexes
    * For tree structured indexes O(n) becomes O(log(n))
* So superior that B trees never actually happened
* Need a query optimizers that can take advantage of these indexes
* All the data is in the data file, and is organized by blocks
    * Sorted by the primary key
    * If it is possible, it is contiguous on disk
    * They fan out a little further than binary trees
* **Primary Key** is how the index is organized
    * These do not have to be unique
    * Index is usually sparse
* **Secondary Key** allows for an additional access path
    * Must be allowed to be not unique
    * Usually dense compared to Primary Keys
* Really the worst case is O(n)
* First you have to sequentially scan table and then can create secondary index??
    * Table in notes has 3 **access paths**
* Good to fatten the nodes and increase fanout in a binary tree

### R 'join' S is proportional to R x S
* If 1 million elements, takes 1 million squared time
* **With secondary key, do indexed loop joins**
    * Most of the time it behaves nlog(n)
    * Don't cluster
* Optimizer recongizes there details exist and uses them to choose an algorithm like **indexed loop joins**
```SQL
CREATE INDEX TC_T_Inventors ON T_INVENTORS(iid); 
/*On default creates secondary index on fk*/
```

### Spare index ###
* not every record's key value is stored in the index
* i.e. if you can't find data in the index, you have to check the sequential file
* more of index can be kept in memory though
* Look becomes a little more difficult
### Dense Index ###
* Can tell if a record exists without accessing a data file
### Split and Promote ###
* Once properly implemented, most nodes are right around half-full.
* **split and promote** is the method of inserting nodes into a B+ tree when there is no space in the block
* surrogates: content addessable pointers
* Basic operations of tree
    * lookup
    * insert
    * delete
* always have to maintain a balanced tree, so might have to create new nodes
* usually, **coalescing** is not implemented because the overhead is not worth it
    * Databases dont shrink often
    * Usually the data will be reinserted later anyway
* manager of file system, keeps heap of filesystem
* Often the indexes are structured as B+ trees

### Clustering ###
* How well sequentially ordered rblocks appear sequentially on disk - i.e. how well blocks are ordered on disk
* Usually only the primary index is clustered
    * This is the reality of physical spinning disks
* To solve the problem of duplicate values and misdirection, use buckets
    * Misdirection is when a leaf points to another leaf
    * 14 byte overhead for each bucket node

### Buckets
|indeces| |records|
|-------|:-|:------:|
|name|PK|emp |
|dept|SK| |
|floor|SK| |
* Assume query to get employee in toy department on the second floor
    * Because of buckets and secondary indices you don't have to dump the whole DB
    * Search department index, takes *log(n)* - find d_bucket
    * Search floor index, takes *log(n)* - find f_bucket
    * Their intersection of d_bucket and f_bucket will give you the record that answers the query
## R - tree
### Multi dimensional (spatial indexing)
Can build a structure that can answer the membership question
All about cutting up space, rather than lines
Incorporate split and promote
Types of queries:
* range queries (SQL, and relational DB)
    * Get back a set
* Nearest neighbor
## kd tree
* Good
    * space is cut up in proportion to the density of popints
    * lrage db O(log(n))
* Bad
    * still a main memory index

### Bitmap index
Very good for Business Intelligence
Resulted from the research in aprallel database systems
Bloom filter is the primary method of indexing in large databases
To create a bitmap index in oracle:
```c++
CREATE BITMAP INDEX
ON Faculty(FacRank);
```
A method, Uses Unary coding

## Bloom Filter
No always means no
Yes really just means maybe

* Access Path
    * set of algorithms that allow you to retrieve data

Query optimization is an NP hard problem

# Three Primary Classses of Join Algorthm
1. Nested Loops
```python
    for r in R
        for s in S
            if pred(r,s) then output result
```

2. Merge Join
3. Hash Joins

Two phase external sort
* external refers to algorithms with data on disk

## Merge sort cost - no index
5(B(R) + B(S))

# Things to read

* HDFS
    * hadoop file system
* Flush
    * flushing a buffer moves it to disk
* DMA
