# CS109 : Programming in Python
## Decorators
* Allow you to write a program and modify how your program behaves
```python
def change(v):
    def decorator(f):
        print(" I am decorator", v)
        @functools.wraps(f)
        def func(*args, **kws):
            return f(*args, **kws)
        return func
    return decorator
```

* ```@functools.wraps(f)``` makes your function func look like f
What will the following print?
```python
@change(10)
def func2(c):
    print("I am func", x)
    return x
```
* This blocks is equivalent to: 
    ```python
    func2 = change(10)(func2)
    ```
The former will print
*  ``` I am decorator 10```
* This is because nothing is run, just declared

```@change(10) ``` will call ```change(v)```
* Tells python to use ```change``` as a decorator, without the ```@``` func2 will be regular function
* With ```change``` there we cannot access the decorator anymore

### Printing errors
```python
print("To error", file=sys.stderr)
```
Also don't forget to look up ```repr```

## Operator overloading
* Want to be able to define a function that we use when we use an operator
* Use ```Magic Methods``` to declare these, there many including:
```python
def __init__: # init method
def __mul__: # for multiplication
```

If argument are out of order 
```python
v * 2 # vector supports scalar mul
2 * v # scalar does not support vector
```
for ```mul``` python will call ```rmul``` which is the reverse multiply
