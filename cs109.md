# CS109 : Programming in Python
## Decorators
```python
def change(v):
    def decorator(f):
        print(" I am decorator", v)
        @functools.wraps(f)
        def func(*args, **kws):
            return f(*args, **kws)
        return func
    return decorator
```
What will the following print?
```python
@change(10)
def func2(c):
    print("I am func", x)
    return x
```
* The former will print
    *  ``` I am decorator 10```
* ```@change(10) ``` will call ```change(v)```
    * Tells python to use ```change``` as a decorator, without the ```@``` func2 will be regular function
    * With ```change``` there we cannot access the decorator anymore
